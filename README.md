# GDP-Time-Series-in-R
This relates to my 6th Econ 323 - Econometrics Analysis 2 assignment. It deals with GDP time series data from various countries in the dataset we were given. In this assignment, I use German data.
In addition, this uses econometric methods to understand the data. For example, I use the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, OLS, GLM, among other methods.
